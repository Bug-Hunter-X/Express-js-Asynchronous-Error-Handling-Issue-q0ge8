# Express.js Asynchronous Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where errors thrown within asynchronous operations inside route handlers are not properly handled, leading to silent failures.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application with a route handler that performs an asynchronous operation.  If this operation throws an error, the error is caught locally within the `.catch` block.  However, this does not prevent the request from hanging; no error response is sent to the client.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a solution to this problem. By using a `try...catch` block around the asynchronous operation, and handling the error appropriately (e.g., sending an error response to the client), we ensure that errors are handled gracefully, improving the robustness of the application.  We also demonstrate using a custom error handler middleware to catch errors that escape the route handlers.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to run the buggy application and `node bugSolution.js` to run the fixed application.

You can test the application by making a request to `http://localhost:3000`. The buggy version will hang, while the fixed version will return a proper response, even if an error occurs during the asynchronous operation.
